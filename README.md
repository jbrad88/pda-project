# Programming for data analysis project 2021

## Introduction
This GitHub repository contain my submission for my project for Programming for Data Analysis 2021. Within this repository, you will find
a Jupyter notebook titled "pda-project.ipynb" which can be run as outlined under "General Usage Information" below. The purpose of the code 
contained within is to meet the following objectives:

- Create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomeon, modeled and synthesised using Python. 
- Choose a real world phenomenon that can be measured and for which at least 100 data points can be collected over at least four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions and their relationships with each other.
- Synthesis / simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible. 
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook - the data itself can simply be displated in an output

## Prerequisites
Before you continue, make sure that you have met the following requirements:

You have installed Python 3.8.3
